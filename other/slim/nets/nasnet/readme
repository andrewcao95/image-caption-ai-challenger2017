fix is new code fixing batch norm in non training mode 
but for existing models using old code training can not use this new code  
so right now still use old code  
when training new models might change to use new code  
also need to check inital image checkpoint is ok  

currently inference will also use batch norming though I fix ramdom seed 
but if your batch image sequence change you still got different inference result
