For single model (InceptionV4 + Luong attention) it can achive cider 1.5 without finetune image model and 1.78 after finetune, using label smoothing it can improve to 1.81. Â   
If using nasnet cant got cider 1.75 before finetune and 1.80 after finetune. Notice nasnet might be slow if using 1 gpu, you'd better set 2 gpu with each gpu batch size 8 for gtx1080ti or each gpu batch size 16 for p40.  
Support scst reinforcement learning but not improve you can help to contribute.
