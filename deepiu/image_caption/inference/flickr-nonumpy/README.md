just show hadoop can work
but now has problem with conf.py 
if using different conf.py
you has to update your full python env 
or you have to manuly copy new conf.py to sitepackage folder
@TODO @FIXME

well use meta graph can solve this problem

for boost.python issue... now the best to do is not to use numpy..
